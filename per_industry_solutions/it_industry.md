## Dollar Pegged Salaries
Due to the recent financial crisis, few companies started giving out dollar pegged salaries. This seems to be essential to protect Sri Lanka's IT industry.

## Flexible work
Prior to COVID lot of Sri Lankan IT companies frowned upon working from home and flexible work hours. Currently most are open for this. We can see following advantages of flexible work.
- Better work life balance.
- Not being overworked to death allows those who want to bootstrap companies to do it.
- Better health.
