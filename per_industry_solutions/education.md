* Education visas for students who wants to study in state / private universities. (To be determined if this exists already).
* Allow ability for private medical universities to exist following a state universities approved syllabus. 
* State sponsored education as scholarships. This allows foreign nationals or locals to pay fully or partially to obtain a degree (few seats and expensive).
* Fully switch to English as the main language for education. 
* Does state universities make a profit? If not create additional courses and programs to make it so.
