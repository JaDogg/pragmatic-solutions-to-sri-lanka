<h1> Why this repo : The problem definition </h1>

This repo is created to identify issues in the functioning of the country which hinders the progress of the country. These are at various instituations, consititutions, law and order, people behavior and thinking, political parties. Minor adjusments in behavior of people, policy reforms could bring drastic improvements in the system. We plan to identify them and push them to the relevent people to implement.
