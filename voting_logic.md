People have all the selection power just before the elections. Most are not aware of the real issues or cunning politicians use tactical timely weapons to stamp the opinions to their advantage. In order to avoid such last moment decision making, a practical guide on voting should be compiled by the public, specially targetting the growing floating vote base. 

<h1>Presidencial election voting logic</h1>

1. Beware of the common candidate. Common candidates like Mythreepala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksha are example of failures. This is because common candidates are used to gather power for the party, but not as a respect of their skills.

2. Presidential candidates who are non party leaders tend to have less support from the parliment. Hence recommendation is not to vote non-party-leaders.

3. Never more than 2 terms. If a president cannot fulfill their promise in 10 years, it will not happen again.

4. Never vote for someone over 60 years. This statement could be something optional, but the old parlimentarians are not updated with the current world trends.

5. Candidate who has at least some experience in a professional setting should be preffered.
